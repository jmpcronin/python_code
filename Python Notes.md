# OOP in Python Class

## Functions vs Methods

Method is called on an object (like a turtle), method can use data in object. Methods are the ways in which we interact with an object. For example, we used an on() method to light up an LED. Methods call on object and give it instructions. Methods can be used to set attributes of an object.

Function is a name for set instructions, it can pass info back and forth when called

```
def tell(intro, punchline):
    print("Knock knock")
    print("Who's there")
    print(intro)
    print(intro + " who")
    print(punchline)

#You might call this function by writing this line of code:

tell("Atch", "Sounds like you’ve got a cold!")
```
## Class
The blueprint we create for an object is called a class.
Class is like a template for objects (cookie cutter, make multiple cookies)
Each instance of the object can change based by changing the attributes

Classes are capitalized to differentiate them from variables

*Note the British spelling of randomise*

Take the quiz to find out how much you have understood about the basic concepts of creating and using objects.

QUIZ RULES
Quizzes do not count towards your course score, they are just to help you learn
You may take as many attempts as you wish to answer each question
You can skip questions and come back to them later if you wish

Attribute – a named piece of data stored within an object. Attributes are the pieces of information stored within an object, just like a collection of variables

Class – a blueprint for making an object

Instance – a specific example of an object

Method – a function called upon an object allowing interaction with that object

Object – groups together data and functions to model something in code. Examples could include a physical item such as an LED, or a digital unit such as a bank account or an enemy in a video game

Object-oriented programming – a different style of programming

Setter – a method whose purpose it is to set a value within an object
